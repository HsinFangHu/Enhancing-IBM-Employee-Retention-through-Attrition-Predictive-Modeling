## Description
The report analyzes employee attrition using data from the "IBM.csv" dataset and builds two predictive models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. It preprocesses the data, encodes categorical variables, and creates dummy variables. 

The Logistic Regression model achieves an 86.90% accuracy rate and perfect specificity, while the Random Forest model achieves an 86.39% accuracy rate and higher sensitivity. Key features influencing attrition, such as monthly income and years at the company, are identified. The report highlights potential overfitting in both models and suggests model refinement.

Overall, it offers valuable insights for HR decision-making to implement retention strategies and foster a positive work environment, reducing attrition and enhancing organizational stability.

## Objectives
1.	Predictive Modeling for Attrition:<br>

â€¢ Develop and evaluate predictive models, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to forecast employee attrition based on historical data.<br>
â€¢ Assess the performance of these models using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and balanced accuracy metrics.<br>
2.	Feature Importance Analysis:<br>
â€¢ Identify key drivers of employee attrition by conducting feature importance analysis on the predictive models.<br>
â€¢ Gain insights into which variables have the most significant impact on attrition predictions and inform HR about critical factors affecting retention.<br>
3.	HR Recommendations for Retention:<br>
â€¢ Provide data-driven recommendations and actionable strategies for the Human Resources Department to reduce employee attrition.<br>
â€¢ Suggest targeted initiatives, such as improving job satisfaction, offering competitive compensation, and enhancing work-life balance to enhance employee retention.<br>
